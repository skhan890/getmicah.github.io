The history of the zero spans mathmaticians, civilizations, and time. Seeing as the this is my first blog post, I thought
it was only appropriate to reflect a bit on the meaning of the number zero and why we sometimes begin counting from it. As the animation 
[here](http://www.slate.com/articles/video/video/2016/06/an_animated_history_of_the_number_zero_video.html) explains, it's history is 
long and it's role is undeniabliy core to our lives today. I got to know the number zero in two forms: 
- 0: the [Western Arabic numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals)
- <span class="post-arabic__content"> Ù </span>: the [Eastern Arabic numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Arabic_numerals)

## Zero-Based Numbering
I learned counting by starting at one. The existance of the material was that which prompted a symbolic representation of it's being. 
One apple, two apples, three apples. Zero apples weren't important because zero apples weren't really apples, they were vacious.
