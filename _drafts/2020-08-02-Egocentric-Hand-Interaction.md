## Initial Situation
A core challenge for immersive environment is overcoming what little can be shared with the outside. Users wearing headset cover their eyeballs with displays designed to block out external light while also requiring the user to position their eyes in the correct position for optimal clarity. Mirroring what the user sees attempts to reduce the secluded effect of this experience by display some version of what is being rendered on the near eyeball displays. With this (typically cropped) mirroring comes a reduction in immersive cues mainly caused by factors like the lack of stereo rendering and reduced field of view in addition to giving up controller on the observers angle of view. These factors contribute to the seclusion of immersive experiences in spaces shared with others.

While networked immersive experiences have lessened the ability to share and interact with others in immersive environments, they don't scale well for large gatherings of users. What would need to happen is each user would require their own personal headset and other infrastructure (if headset isn't standalone) to share the experiences being presented to them. Additionally, developing software that brings user's into the same space has gotten much easier in the past 2 years but remains a large investment of time. This presents us with a bottle neck. Either remain in seclusion or find a way to gather enough money to buy each user you intend on bringing into the experience. In the case of university classrooms, this challenge is abundantly clear.

Another solution to building shared immersive experiences has also emerged in the form of holographic displays. One such display is the Looking Glass. The goal is to be able to present depth queues similar to that of stereoscopic rendering on a display that is viewable from multiple angles and to groups of observers at the same time. This presents us with a possible way to display 3D data in an shared immersive manner without the need.
